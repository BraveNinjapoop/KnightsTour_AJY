# KnightsTour_AJY
Hey Dr. K, my Project is pretty sparce just because I made some huge mistakes on the project that ended up costing my that time I worked on 
it and what I had finished. I didn't read the instructions thourgly when I started this, thus I created an entire Heuristic Tour for the 
Knights Table that worked, but it didn't utalize the Arrays properly. Was hyped to be done with the Project, then read the instructions again
and found my mistakes with recording the data and implemeneting the data in a [x][y] 8 [x][y] format. I've got most of the code in there for
how I wanted it to work with a randomly generated starting position for the Knight itself, but I could not get it working, so I commented
the code out.
